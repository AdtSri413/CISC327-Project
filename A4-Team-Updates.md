## Aditi

#### what is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).

feature/Aditi/PROJ-401/Set-up-repo-for-unittests
feature/Aditi/PROJ-404/Test-create-listing

#### what is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2)

Finished updating repo. Finished writing testcases, but some are failing.

#### any difficulties.

Some testcases are failing, I think due to the patch method I have used to mock the backend.

#### what is the plan for the days before the deadline.

Talk to Malthus and Shawn to fix the testcases, make a PR, get approval, merge. Will push my branch once the unittests pass.


## Anirudh

#### what is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).

Feature/Anirudh/PROJ-406/Test-Update_User

#### what is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2)

Written test_edit_page_nonalpha_postal, test_edit_page__specicalchar_postal, test_edit_page_valid_postal unittests

#### any difficulties.

No difficulties so far.

#### what is the plan for the days before the deadline.

Finish up writing the test cases by Thursday afternoon. Debug and push by the night if there are any issues.


## Malthus

#### what is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).

feature/Malthus/PROJ-402/Test-Register
feature/Malthus/PROJ-403/Test-Login

#### what is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2)

All test cases for registration have been done and merged. Test cases for login have been done but not yet pushed and merged, will do so today.

#### any difficulties.

No difficulties, just had to wait for the registration code to be merged before I could push the login changes (since the registration logic is slightly different now).

#### what is the plan for the days before the deadline.

Finish login test cases, check to see if all tests pass, then push and merge it to main.
